title: About us
---

[Spatie](https://spatie.be) is a webdesign agency based in Antwerp, Belgium.

Open source software is used in all projects we deliver. Laravel, Nginx, Ubuntu are just a few 
of the free pieces of software we use every single day. For this, we are very grateful. 
When we feel we have solved a problem in a way that can help other developers, 
we release our code as open source software [on GitHub](https://spatie.be/opensource).

This package is heavily based on [Jeffrey Way](https://twitter.com/jeffrey_way)'s awesome [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) lessons
on [permissions and roles](https://laracasts.com/series/whats-new-in-laravel-5-1/episodes/16). His original code
can be found [in this repo on GitHub](https://github.com/laracasts/laravel-5-roles-and-permissions-demo).

Special thanks to [Alex Vanderbist](https://github.com/AlexVanderbist) who greatly helped with `v2`, and to [Chris Brown](https://github.com/drbyte) for his longtime support  helping us maintain the package.
