title: Direct Permissions

A permission can be given to any user:

```php
$user->givePermissionTo('edit articles');

// You can also give multiple permission at once
$user->givePermissionTo('edit articles', 'delete articles');

// You may also pass an array
$user->givePermissionTo(['edit articles', 'delete articles']);
```

A permission can be revoked from a user:

```php
$user->revokePermissionTo('edit articles');
```

Or revoke & add new permissions in one go:

```php
$user->syncPermissions(['edit articles', 'delete articles']);
```

You can check if a user has a permission:

```php
$user->hasPermissionTo('edit articles');
```

Or you may pass an integer representing the permission id

```php
$user->hasPermissionTo('1');
$user->hasPermissionTo(Permission::find(1)->id);
$user->hasPermissionTo($somePermission->id);
```

You can check if a user has Any of an array of permissions:

```php
$user->hasAnyPermission(['edit articles', 'publish articles', 'unpublish articles']);
```

...or if a user has All of an array of permissions:

```php
$user->hasAllPermissions(['edit articles', 'publish articles', 'unpublish articles']);
```

...or if a user has ANY permission matching a regular expression

```php
$user->hasPregPermission('publish articles'); // Matches "publish articles" AND "unpublish articles"
```

You may also pass integers to lookup by permission id

```php
$user->hasAnyPermission(['edit articles', 1, 5]);
```

Saved permissions will be registered with the `Illuminate\Auth\Access\Gate` class for the default guard. So you can
check if a user has a permission with Laravel's default `can` function:

```php
$user->can('edit articles');
```
