## Need a UI?

The package doesn't come with any UI/screens out of the box, you should build that yourself. 

But: [do you really need a UI? Consider what Aaron and Joel have to say in this podcast episode](https://show.nocompromises.io/episodes/should-you-manage-roles-and-permissions-with-a-ui)

If you decide you need a UI, even if it's not for creating/editing role/permission names, but just for controlling which Users have access to which roles/permissions, following are some options to get you started:

- [Code With Tony - video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGfV1ddMhHA) to create an admin panel for managing roles and permissions in Laravel 9.

- [FilamentPHP plugin](https://filamentphp.com/plugins/tharinda-rodrigo-spatie-roles-permissions) to manage roles and permissions using this package. (There are a few other Filament plugins which do similarly; use whichever suits your needs best.)

- If you'd like to build your own UI, and understand the underlying logic for Gates and Roles and Users, the [Laravel 6  User Login and Management With Roles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PpJsho5aak&list=PLxFwlLOncxFLazmEPiB4N0iYc3Dwst6m4) video series by Mark Twigg of Penguin Digital gives thorough coverage to the topic, the theory, and implementation of a basic Roles system, independent of this Permissions Package.
