- Change cache config time to DateInterval instead of integer

This is in preparation for compatibility with Laravel 5.8's cache TTL change to seconds instead of minutes.

NOTE: If you leave your existing `config/permission.php` file alone, then with Laravel 5.8 the `60 * 24` will change from being treated as 24 hours to just 24 minutes. Depending on your app, this may or may not make a significant difference.  Updating your config file to a specific DateInterval will add specificity and insulate you from the TTL change in Laravel 5.8.

https://github.com/laravel/framework/commit/fd6eb89b62ec09df1ffbee164831a827e83fa61d

## 2.29.0 - 2018-12-15

- Use config settings for cache reset in migration stub

## 2.28.1 - 2018-12-07

- Remove use of Cache facade, for Lumen compatibility

## 2.28.0 - 2018-11-30

- Rename `getCacheKey` method in HasPermissions trait to `getPermissionCacheKey` for clearer specificity.

## 2.27.0 - 2018-11-21

- Add ability to specify a cache driver for roles/permissions caching

## 2.26.2 - 2018-11-20

- Added the ability to reset the permissions cache via an Artisan command:
- `php artisan permission:cache-reset`

## 2.26.1 - 2018-11-19

- minor update to de-duplicate code overhead
- numerous internal updates to cache tests infrastructure

## 2.26.0 - 2018-11-19

- Substantial speed increase by caching the associations between models and permissions

### NOTES:

The following changes are not "breaking", but worth making the updates to your app for consistency.

1. Config file: The `config/permission.php` file changed to move cache-related settings into a sub-array. **You should review the changes and merge the updates into your own config file.** Specifically the `expiration_time` value has moved into a sub-array entry, and the old top-level entry is no longer used.
2. See the original config file here:
3. https://github.com/spatie/laravel-permission/blob/main/config/permission.php
4. 
5. Cache Resets: If your `app` or `tests` are clearing the cache by specifying the cache key, **it is better to use the built-in forgetCachedPermissions() method** so that it properly handles tagged cache entries. Here is the recommended change:
6. 

```diff
- app()['cache']->forget('spatie.permission.cache');
+ $this->app->make(\Spatie\Permission\PermissionRegistrar::class)->forgetCachedPermissions();



```
1. Also this is a good time to point out that now with v2.25.0 and v2.26.0 most permission-cache-reset scenarios may no longer be needed in your app, so it's worth reviewing those cases, as you may gain some app speed improvement by removing unnecessary cache resets.

## 2.25.0 - 2018-11-07

- A model's `roles` and `permissions` relations (respectively) are now automatically reloaded after an Assign/Remove role or Grant/Revoke of permissions. This means there's no longer a need to call `-&amp;gt;fresh()` on the model if the only reason is to reload the role/permission relations. (That said, you may want to call it for other reasons.)
- Added support for passing id to HasRole()

## 2.24.0 - 2018-11-06

- Fix operator used on RoleOrPermissionMiddleware, and avoid throwing PermissionDoesNotExist if invalid permission passed
- Auto-reload model role relation after using AssignRole
- Avoid empty permission creation when using the CreateRole command

## 2.23.0 - 2018-10-15

- Avoid unnecessary queries of user roles when fetching all permissions

## 2.22.1 - 2018-10-15

- Fix Lumen issue with Route helper added in 2.22.0

## 2.22.0 - 2018-10-11

- Added `Route::role()` and `Route::permission()` middleware helper functions
- Added new `role_or_permission` middleware to allow specifying "or" combinations

## 2.21.0 - 2018-09-29

- Revert changes from 2.17.1 in order to support Lumen 5.7

## 2.20.0 - 2018-09-19

- It will sync roles/permissions to models that are not persisted, by registering a `saved` callback.
- (It would previously throw an Integrity constraint violation QueryException on the pivot table insertion.)

## 2.19.2 - 2018-09-19

- add `@elserole` directive:
- Usage:

```php
@role('roleA')
 // user hasRole 'roleA'
@elserole('roleB')
 // user hasRole 'roleB' but not 'roleA'
@endrole



```
## 2.19.1 - 2018-09-14

- Spark-related fix to accommodate missing guard[providers] config

## 2.19.0 - 2018-09-10

- Add ability to pass in IDs or mixed values to `role` scope
- Add `@unlessrole`/`@endunlessrole` Blade directives

## 2.18.0 - 2018-09-06

- Expanded CLI `permission:create-role` command to create optionally create-and-link permissions in one command. Also now no longer throws an error if the role already exists.

## 2.17.1 - 2018-08-28

- Require laravel/framework instead of illuminate/* starting from ~5.4.0
- Removed old dependency for illuminate/database@~5.3.0 (Laravel 5.3 is not supported)

## 2.17.0 - 2018-08-24

- Laravel 5.7 compatibility

## 2.16.0 - 2018-08-20

- Added type checking in hasPermissionTo and hasDirectPermission

## 2.15.0 - 2018-08-15

- Make assigning the same role or permission twice not throw an exception

## 2.14.0 - 2018-08-13

- Allow using another key name than `model_id` by defining new `columns` array with `model_morph_key` key in config file. This improves UUID compatibility as discussed in #777.

## 2.13.0 - 2018-08-02

- Fix issue with null values passed to syncPermissions & syncRoles

## 2.12.2 - 2018-06-13

- added hasAllPermissions method

## 2.12.1 - 2018-04-23

- Reverted 2.12.0. REVERTS: "Add ability to pass guard name to gate methods like can()". Requires reworking of guard handling if we're going to add this feature.
