## 2.30.0 - 2019-01-28
- Change cache config time to DateInterval instead of integer

This is in preparation for compatibility with Laravel 5.8's cache TTL change to seconds instead of minutes.

NOTE: If you leave your existing `config/permission.php` file alone, then with Laravel 5.8 the `60 * 24` will change from being treated as 24 hours to just 24 minutes. Depending on your app, this may or may not make a significant difference.  Updating your config file to a specific DateInterval will add specificity and insulate you from the TTL change in Laravel 5.8.

## 2.29.0 - 2018-12-15
- Fix bound `saved` event from firing on all subsequent models when calling assignRole or givePermissionTo on unsaved models. However, it is preferable to save the model first, and then add roles/permissions after saving. See #971.

## 2.28.2 - 2018-12-10
- Use config settings for cache reset in migration stub

## 2.28.1 - 2018-12-07
- Remove use of Cache facade, for Lumen compatibility

## 2.28.0 - 2018-11-30
- Rename `getCacheKey` method in HasPermissions trait to `getPermissionCacheKey` for clearer specificity. 

## 2.27.0 - 2018-11-21
- Add ability to specify a cache driver for roles/permissions caching

## 2.26.2 - 2018-11-20
- Added the ability to reset the permissions cache via an Artisan command:
`php artisan permission:cache-reset`

## 2.26.1 - 2018-11-19
- minor update to de-duplicate code overhead
- numerous internal updates to cache tests infrastructure

## 2.26.0 - 2018-11-19
- Substantial speed increase by caching the associations between models and permissions

### NOTES: ###
The following changes are not "breaking", but worth making the updates to your app for consistency.

1. Config file: The `config/permission.php` file changed to move cache-related settings into a sub-array. **You should review the changes and merge the updates into your own config file.** Specifically the `expiration_time` value has moved into a sub-array entry, and the old top-level entry is no longer used.
See the master config file here: 
https://github.com/spatie/laravel-permission/blob/master/config/permission.php

2. Cache Resets: If your `app` or `tests` are clearing the cache by specifying the cache key, **it is better to use the built-in forgetCachedPermissions() method** so that it properly handles tagged cache entries. Here is the recommended change:
```diff
- app()['cache']->forget('spatie.permission.cache');
+ $this->app->make(\Spatie\Permission\PermissionRegistrar::class)->forgetCachedPermissions();
```

3. Also this is a good time to point out that now with v2.25.0 and v2.26.0 most permission-cache-reset scenarios may no longer be needed in your app, so it's worth reviewing those cases, as you may gain some app speed improvement by removing unnecessary cache resets.


## 2.25.0 - 2018-11-07
- A model's `roles` and `permissions` relations (respectively) are now automatically reloaded after an Assign/Remove role or Grant/Revoke of permissions. This means there's no longer a need to call `->fresh()` on the model if the only reason is to reload the role/permission relations. (That said, you may want to call it for other reasons.)
- Added support for passing id to HasRole()

## 2.24.0 - 2018-11-06
- Fix operator used on RoleOrPermissionMiddleware, and avoid throwing PermissionDoesNotExist if invalid permission passed
- Auto-reload model role relation after using AssignRole
- Avoid empty permission creation when using the CreateRole command

## 2.23.0 - 2018-10-15
- Avoid unnecessary queries of user roles when fetching all permissions

## 2.22.1 - 2018-10-15
- Fix Lumen issue with Route helper added in 2.22.0

## 2.22.0 - 2018-10-11

## 2.20.0 - 2018-09-19
- It will sync roles/permissions to models that are not persisted, by registering a `saved` callback. 
(It would previously throw an Integrity constraint violation QueryException on the pivot table insertion.)

## 2.19.2 - 2018-09-19
- add `@elserole` directive:
 Usage: 
```php
@role('roleA')
 // user hasRole 'roleA'
@elserole('roleB')
 // user hasRole 'roleB' but not 'roleA'
@endrole
```

## 2.19.1 - 2018-09-14
- Spark-related fix to accommodate missing guard[providers] config

## 2.19.0 - 2018-09-10
- Add ability to pass in IDs or mixed values to `role` scope
- Add `@unlessrole`/`@endunlessrole` Blade directives

## 2.18.0 - 2018-09-06

## 2.17.1 - 2018-08-28
- Require laravel/framework instead of illuminate/* starting from ~5.4.0 
- Removed old dependency for illuminate/database@~5.3.0 (Laravel 5.3 is not supported)

## 2.17.0 - 2018-08-24
- Laravel 5.7 compatibility

## 2.16.0 - 2018-08-20

## 2.15.0 - 2018-08-15
- Make assigning the same role or permission twice not throw an exception

## 2.14.0 - 2018-08-13
- Allow using another key name than `model_id` by defining new `columns` array with `model_morph_key` key in config file. This improves UUID compatibility as discussed in #777.

## 2.13.0 - 2018-08-02
- Fix issue with null values passed to syncPermissions & syncRoles

## 2.12.2 - 2018-06-13
- added hasAllPermissions method

## 2.12.1 - 2018-04-23
- Reverted 2.12.0. REVERTS: "Add ability to pass guard name to gate methods like can()". Requires reworking of guard handling if we're going to add this feature. 

## 2.12.0 - 2018-04-22
- Add ability to pass guard name to gate methods like can()

- Improve speed of permission lookups with findByName, findById, findOrCreate

## 2.10.0 - 2018-04-15
- changes the type-hinted Authenticatable to Authorizable in the PermissionRegistrar.
(Previously it was expecting models to implement the Authenticatable contract; but really that should have been Authorizable, since that's where the Gate functionality really is.)

- Now findOrCreate() exists for both Roles and Permissions
- Internal code refactoring for future dev work

## 2.9.1 - 2018-02-23

 - A configuration option may be set to include the list of required roles/permissions in the message

## 2.7.8 - 2018-01-02
- REVERTED: Dynamic permission_id and role_id columns according to tables name
