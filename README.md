This package allows you to manage user permissions and roles in a database.

Once installed you can do stuff like this:

```php
// Adding permissions to a user
$user->givePermissionTo('edit articles');

// Adding permissions via a role
$user->assignRole('writer');

$role->givePermissionTo('edit articles');
```

If you're using multiple guards we've got you covered as well. Every guard will have its own set of permissions and roles that can be assigned to the guard's users. Read about it in the [using multiple guards](#using-multiple-guards) section of the readme.

Because all permissions will be registered on [Laravel's gate](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/authorization), you can test if a user has a permission with Laravel's default `can` function:

```php
$user->can('edit articles');
```

## Installation

This package can be used in Laravel 5.4 or higher. If you are using an older version of Laravel, take a look at [the v1 branch of this package](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-permission/tree/v1).

You can install the package via composer:

``` bash
composer require spatie/laravel-permission
```

Now add the service provider in `config/app.php` file:

```php
'providers' => [
    // ...
    Spatie\Permission\PermissionServiceProvider::class,
];
```

You can publish the migration with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Permission\PermissionServiceProvider" --tag="migrations"
```

After the migration has been published you can create the role- and permission-tables by
running the migrations:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Permission\PermissionServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

This is the contents of the published `config/permission.php` config file:

```php
return [

    'models' => [

## Usage

First add the `Spatie\Permission\Traits\HasRoles` trait to your User model(s):

```php
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
use Spatie\Permission\Traits\HasRoles;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use HasRoles;

    // ...
}
```

> - note that if you need to use `HasRoles` trait with another model ex.`Page` you will also need to add `protected $guard_name = 'web';` as well to that model or you would get an error
>
>```php
>use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
>use Spatie\Permission\Traits\HasRoles;
>
>class Page extends Model
>{
>    use HasRoles;
>
>    protected $guard_name = 'web'; // or whatever guard you want to use
>
>    // ...
>}
>```

This package allows for users to be associated with permissions and roles. Every role is associated with multiple permissions.
A `Role` and a `Permission` are regular Eloquent models. They have a name and can be created like this:

```php
use Spatie\Permission\Models\Role;
use Spatie\Permission\Models\Permission;

$role = Role::create(['name' => 'writer']);
$permission = Permission::create(['name' => 'edit articles']);
```

If you're using multiple guards the `guard_name` attribute needs to be set as well. Read about it in the [using multiple guards](#using-multiple-guards) section of the readme.

The `HasRoles` adds Eloquent relationships to your models, which can be accessed directly or used as a base query:

```php
$permissions = $user->permissions;
$roles = $user->roles->pluck('name'); // Returns a collection
```

The `HasRoles` also adds a scope to your models to scope the query to certain roles:

```php
$users = User::role('writer')->get(); // Only returns users with the role 'writer'
```

The scope can accept a string, a `\Spatie\Permission\Models\Role` object or an `\Illuminate\Support\Collection` object.

### Using permissions

A permission can be given to any user with the `HasRoles` trait:

```php
$user->givePermissionTo('edit articles');

// You can also give multiple permission at once
$user->givePermissionTo('edit articles', 'delete articles');

// You may also pass an array
$user->givePermissionTo(['edit articles', 'delete articles']);
```

A permission can be revoked from a user:

```php
$user->revokePermissionTo('edit articles');
```

Or revoke & add new permissions in one go:

```php
$user->syncPermissions(['edit articles', 'delete articles']);
```

You can test if a user has a permission:

```php
$user->hasPermissionTo('edit articles');
```

...or if a user has multiple permissions:

```php
$user->hasAnyPermission(['edit articles', 'publish articles', 'unpublish articles']);
```

Saved permissions will be registered with the `Illuminate\Auth\Access\Gate` class for the default guard. So you can
test if a user has a permission with Laravel's default `can` function:

```php
$user->can('edit articles');
```

### Using permissions and roles

A role can be assigned to any user with the `HasRoles` trait:

```php
$user->assignRole('writer');

// You can also assign multiple roles at once
$user->assignRole('writer', 'admin');
$user->assignRole(['writer', 'admin']);
```

A role can be removed from a user:

```php
$user->removeRole('writer');
```

Roles can also be synced:

```php
// All current roles will be removed from the user and replace by the array given
$user->syncRoles(['writer', 'admin']);
```

You can determine if a user has a certain role:

```php
$user->hasRole('writer');
```

You can also determine if a user has any of a given list of roles:

```php
$user->hasAnyRole(Role::all());
```

You can also determine if a user has all of a given list of roles:

```php
$user->hasAllRoles(Role::all());
```

The `assignRole`, `hasRole`, `hasAnyRole`, `hasAllRoles`  and `removeRole` functions can accept a
 string, a `\Spatie\Permission\Models\Role` object or an `\Illuminate\Support\Collection` object.

A permission can be given to a role:

```php
$role->givePermissionTo('edit articles');
```

You can determine if a role has a certain permission:

```php
$role->hasPermissionTo('edit articles');
```

A permission can be revoked from a role:

```php
$role->revokePermissionTo('edit articles');
```

The `givePermissionTo` and `revokePermissionTo` functions can accept a
string or a `Spatie\Permission\Models\Permission` object.

Saved permission and roles are also registered with the `Illuminate\Auth\Access\Gate` class.

```php
$user->can('edit articles');
```

All permissions of roles that user is assigned to are inherited to the
user automatically. In addition to these permissions particular permission can be assigned to the user too. For instance:

```php
$role->givePermissionTo('edit articles');

$user->assignRole('writer');

$user->givePermissionTo('delete articles');
```

In above example a role is given permission to edit articles and this role is assigned to a user. Now user can edit articles and additionally delete articles. The permission of 'delete articles' is his direct permission because it is assigned directly to him. When we call `$user->hasDirectPermission('delete articles')` it returns `true` and `false` for `$user->hasDirectPermission('edit articles')`.

This method is useful if one has a form for setting permissions for roles and users in his application and want to restrict to change inherited permissions of roles of user, i.e. allowing to change only direct permissions of user.

You can list all of theses permissions:

```php
// Direct permissions
$user->getDirectPermissions() // Or $user->permissions;

// Permissions inherited from user's roles
$user->getPermissionsViaRoles();

// All permissions which apply on the user
$user->getAllPermissions();
```

All theses responses are collections of `Spatie\Permission\Models\Permission` objects.

If we follow the previous example, the first response will be a collection with the 'delete article' permission, the
second will be a collection with the 'edit article' permission and the third will contain both.

### Using Blade directives
This package also adds Blade directives to verify whether the currently logged in user has all or any of a given list of
roles. Optionally you can pass in the `guard` that the check will be performed on as a second argument.

```php
@role('writer')
    I'm a writer!
@else
    I'm not a writer...
@endrole
```

```php
@hasrole('writer')
    I'm a writer!
@else
    I'm not a writer...
@endhasrole
```

```php
@hasanyrole(Role::all())
    I have one or more of these roles!
@else
    I have none of these roles...
@endhasanyrole
// or
@hasanyrole('writer|admin')
    I have one or more of these roles!
@else
    I have none of these roles...
@endhasanyrole
```

```php
@hasallroles(Role::all())
    I have all of these roles!
@else
    I don't have all of these roles...
@endhasallroles
//or
@hasallroles('writer|admin')
    I have all of these roles!
@else
    I don't have all of these roles...
@endhasallroles
```

You can use Laravel's native `@can` directive to check if a user has a certain permission.

## Using multiple guards

When using the default Laravel auth configuration all of the above methods will work out of the box, no extra configuration required.

However when using multiple guards they will act like namespaces for your permissions and roles. Meaning every guard has its own set of permissions and roles that can be assigned to their user model.

### Using permissions and roles with multiple guards

By default the default guard (`auth.default.guard`) will be used as the guard for new permissions and roles. When creating permissions and roles for specific guards you'll have to specify their `guard_name` on the model:

```php
// Create a superadmin role for the admin users
$role = Role::create(['guard_name' => 'admin', 'name' => 'superadmin']);

// Define a `create posts` permission for the admin users beloninging to the admin guard
$permission = Permission::create(['guard_name' => 'admin', 'name' => 'create posts']);

// Define a different `create posts` permission for the regular users belonging to the web guard
$permission = Permission::create(['guard_name' => 'web', 'name' => 'create posts']);
```

This is how you can check if a user has permission for a specific guard:

```php
$permissionName = 'edit articles';
$guardName = 'api';

$user->hasPermissionTo($permissionName, $guardName);
```

### Assigning permissions and roles to guard users

You can use the same methods to assign permissions and roles to users as described above in [using permissions and roles](#using-permissions-and-roles). Just make sure the `guard_name`s on the permission or role match the guard of the user, otherwise a `GuardDoesNotMatch` exception will be thrown.

### Using blade directives with multiple guards

You can use all of the blade directives listed in [using blade directives](#using-blade-directives) by passing in the guard you wish to use as the second argument to the directive:

```php
@role('super-admin', 'admin')
    I'm a super-admin!
@else
    I'm not a super-admin...
@endrole
```

## Using a middleware

This package comes with `RoleMiddleware` and `PermissionMiddleware` middleware. You can add them inside your `app/Http/Kernel.php` file.

```php
protected $routeMiddleware = [
    // ...
    'role' => \Spatie\Permission\Middlewares\RoleMiddleware::class,
    'permission' => \Spatie\Permission\Middlewares\PermissionMiddleware::class,
];
```

Now you can protect your routes using the middleware you just set up:

```php
Route::group(['middleware' => ['role:admin']], function () {
    //
});

Route::group(['middleware' => ['permission:access_backend']], function () {
    //
});

Route::group(['middleware' => ['role:admin','permission:access_backend']], function () {
    //
});
```

## Using artisan commands

You can create a role or permission from console with artisan commands.

```bash
php artisan permission:create-role writer
```

```bash
php artisan permission:create-permission edit-articles
```

When creating permissions and roles for specific guards you'll can to specify the guard names as a second argument:

```bash
php artisan permission:create-role writer web
```

```bash
php artisan permission:create-permission edit-articles web
```

## Database Seeding

Two notes about Database Seeding:

1. It is best to flush the `spatie.permission.cache` before seeding, to avoid cache conflict errors. This can be done from an Artisan command (see Troubleshooting: Cache section, later) or directly in a seeder class (see example below).

2. Here's a sample seeder, which clears the cache, creates permissions, and then assigns permissions to roles:

	```php
	use Illuminate\Database\Seeder;
	use Spatie\Permission\Models\Role;
	use Spatie\Permission\Models\Permission;

	class RolesAndPermissionsSeeder extends Seeder
	{
	    public function run()
    	{
        	// Reset cached roles and permissions
	        app()['cache']->forget('spatie.permission.cache');

	        // create permissions
	        Permission::create(['name' => 'edit posts']);
	        Permission::create(['name' => 'delete posts']);
	        Permission::create(['name' => 'delete users']);

	        // create roles and assign existing permissions
	        $role = Role::create(['name' => 'Author']);
	        $role->givePermissionTo('edit posts');
	        $role->givePermissionTo('delete posts');

	        $role = Role::create(['name' => 'Manager']);
	        $role->givePermissionTo('delete users');
	    }
	}

	```

## Extending

If you need to extend or replace the existing `Role` or `Permission` models you just need to
keep the following things in mind:

- Your `Role` model needs to implement the `Spatie\Permission\Contracts\Role` contract
- Your `Permission` model needs to implement the `Spatie\Permission\Contracts\Permission` contract
- You must publish the configuration with this command:
  ```bash
  $ php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Permission\PermissionServiceProvider" --tag="config"
  ```
  And update the `models.role` and `models.permission` values

## Troubleshooting

### Cache

If you manipulate permission/role data directly in the database instead of calling the supplied methods, then you will not see the changes reflected in the application, because role and permission data is cached to speed up performance.

To manually reset the cache for this package, run:
```bash
php artisan cache:forget spatie.permission.cache
```

When you use the supplied methods, such as the following, the cache is automatically reset for you:

```php
// see earlier in the README for how these methods work:
$user->assignRole('writer');
$user->removeRole('writer');
$role->givePermissionTo('edit articles');
$role->revokePermissionTo('edit articles');
```

## Need a UI?

The package doesn't come with any screens out of the box, you should build that yourself. To get started check out [this extensive tutorial](https://scotch.io/tutorials/user-authorization-in-laravel-54-with-spatie-laravel-permission) by [Caleb Oki](http://www.caleboki.com/).
