## Documentation, Installation, and Usage Instructions

See the [documentation](https://spatie.be/docs/laravel-permission/) for detailed installation and usage instructions.

## What It Does
This package allows you to manage user permissions and roles in a database.

Once installed you can do stuff like this:

```php
// Adding permissions to a user
$user->givePermissionTo('edit articles');

// Adding permissions via a role
$user->assignRole('writer');

$role->givePermissionTo('edit articles');
```

Because all permissions will be registered on [Laravel's gate](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization), you can check if a user has a permission with Laravel's default `can` function:

```php
$user->can('edit articles');
```

## Alternatives

- [Povilas Korop](https://twitter.com/@povilaskorop) did an excellent job listing the alternatives [in an article on Laravel News](https://laravel-news.com/two-best-roles-permissions-packages). In that same article, he compares laravel-permission to [Joseph Silber](https://github.com/JosephSilber)'s [Bouncer]((https://github.com/JosephSilber/bouncer)), which in our book is also an excellent package.
- [santigarcor/laratrust](https://github.com/santigarcor/laratrust) implements team support
- [ultraware/roles](https://github.com/ultraware/roles) (archived) takes a slightly different approach to its features.
- [zizaco/entrust](https://github.com/zizaco/entrust) offers some wildcard pattern matching
